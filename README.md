# cherie

This is a coding project made for the sake of studying finite state machines' artificial intelligence implementation and practicing object oriented programming in C++. Here are few explanations about the initial concept:

# who is cherie ?

Cherie is a dog. I asked a friend of mine if she could describe her canine fellow Cherie so I could design the animal as a finite state machine. She told me basically what her dog does all day, so I could turn her into an actual machine. Cherie has some simple states:

# cherie's states:

* lain : cherie sleeps a lot.
* scrathing : cherie scratches herself 90% of the time.
* begging : cherie begs for food while her owners eat.
* pissing : cherie pisses a lot on the carpet. A lot.
* eating : cherie eats
* drinking : cherie drinks

# how to run (linux)

You will need:
* g++ compiler (4.8.4 or higher)

How to compile:

	~$ g++ *.cpp
	~$ g++ *.o

Now execute:

	~$ ./a.out
